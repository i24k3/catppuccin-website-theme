# catppuccin-website-theme

> everything you see is colored by your mind. this theme just makes that literal.

## intro

i'm not here to convince you. themes are just a vibe, right? but ask yourself — how many sites have you seen today that *feel* good to look at? most of them just throw pixels at you. too bright, too loud. you scroll, you click, you forget.

so i made this.

a simple chrome theme that wraps everything in the catppuccin color scheme — calm, cozy, soft on the eyes. it’s not trying to change the world, it’s just trying to give your browser some peace. what you do with that peace is on you.

## why tho?

i asked myself that too. why make a theme when there are already so many out there?

but then again — why do you sit where you sit?  
why do you listen to the songs you do?  
why do you open chrome based browsers and not some other browser?

most of the stuff we do is just repeated memory. something that worked once. maybe you never thought about it. but here’s a theme that wants you to.  

not telling you what’s right. just asking: *why this?*

## motivation

it's nothing fancy i was just ricing my linux setup (arch btw) with sway window manager and the theme i set everywhere was catppuccin (hardcoded or some already created). but the only place i felt demotivated was while surfing web, I really tried to get one decent theme but nothing made me happy so i finally took things into my hands and (literally paste that thano's moment here : i'll do it myself). Long story short here we are.


> have fun
